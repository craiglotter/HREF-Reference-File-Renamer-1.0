HREF Reference File Renamer 1.0

HREF Reference File Renamer is a simple tool used to name linked files according to the textual description found in the anchor tag of a HTML document. For instance, should a local webpage contain the following line: "<a href="Go.doc">How to Play Go</a>", the program will rename "Go.doc" to "How_to_Play_Go.doc".
